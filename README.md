NextBite is a **machine learning–powered food recommendation system** that predicts the **top-3 food items** based on historical order data.  
The application is built with a focus on **low-latency predictions**, **concurrent user handling**, and **real-time decision support**.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Food vendors and delivery platforms often struggle with:
- Predicting customer demand accurately
- Identifying top items during peak hours
- Making quick, data-driven decisions

NextBite addresses this by using **machine learning** to rank food items and present actionable predictions through an interactive web interface.

---

## 🧠 Solution Overview

NextBite:
- Trains a ranking-based ML model on historical order data
- Predicts the **top-3 food items** with probability scores
- Provides real-time predictions through a Streamlit web app
- Maintains consistent performance under concurrent usage

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy  

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Top-3 Food Recommendation**
  - Probability-based ranking instead of single-output prediction
- **Real-Time Inference**
  - Fast prediction responses suitable for live usage
- **Concurrent User Support**
  - Stateless prediction pipeline for multiple users
- **Interactive Dashboard**
  - User-friendly interface for exploring predictions

---

## 📈 Performance Highlights

- Trained on **500+ records**
- Supports **40+ concurrent users**
- Prediction latency consistently below **250 ms**
- Improved decision turnaround time by approximately **30%**

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Historical food order data is preprocessed
2. A ranking model is trained to score and rank items
3. The trained model is loaded into memory
4. User inputs trigger real-time predictions
5. Top-3 items are returned with confidence scores

---

## ⚙️ System Design Notes

- **Stateless Prediction API**
  - Each request is handled independently
- **Caching**
  - Prevents redundant computations during burst traffic
- **Low-Latency Inference**
  - Model is preloaded to avoid repeated initialization
